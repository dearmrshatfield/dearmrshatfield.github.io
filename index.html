                <h11>I'm sorry for missing your class, ESPECIALLY on the day of your test, and not notifying you beforehand! ): I was too embarrassed and ashamed to send an email because I felt like I would be basically rubbing in that I couldn't make it, while everyone else could. But it would have been only right to at least let you know what I was doing! I was completely irresponsible and wrong to not finish the essay long beforehand, let alone miss your class to make up for my own mistake, and for that I sincerely am sorry. In my head during the middle of my writing rush, I wasn't worried about missing any other class as much as yours, not because I was afraid of the things I would have to do to make up for it, but because I was so afraid of how you would react. I guess I was so scared that you'd be mad at me that I chickened out and my head just wasn't thinking properly D:! My actions have been unacceptable, and I deeply regret them.
                    <br><br>I like to try and make everyone happy, and of course, not cause any more problems because everyone already has enough to deal with. Knowing that I've disappointed you makes me feel completely awful... It's my dream job to make others laugh, not unhappy. I definitely don't see your class as not important AT ALL! To be honest, I actually really love your class because the content is pretty cool when it all comes together and makes sense, AND ALSO because of you. You're the most animate and real teacher I've had in my entire life, and I truly appreciate that. ^-^ I get to come into class and never fail to have a little moment to chuckle at your story or reaction to another student. I love to be included in the know of your life (as odd/creepy as that sounds, I'm sorry ; ~ ;!) because I find a lot of things really interesting. BUT, this also makes me feel even WORSE about what I did T~T! It's my favorite class, and I ruined it because of my procrastination habits. I'm not saying it just to say it, I sincerely mean it! I promised myself that I would fix it because I wanted to not be dragged into that SENIORITIS. I want to end my Senior Year strong, which hasn't been working out as I hoped :\.
                    <br><br>This has been my most difficult school year yet, mostly because I have a hard time dealing with emotional things at home. Lately, I've been trying to get away more often. For the Soul Purpose show, we had two weeks of tech rehearsals, lasting each day afterschool to 9 at night. It really helped me get my mind off of things, but it was also really stressful because it was literally everything that we've worked for the entire year, perfected in two weeks, and performed in two shows. I would do homework and study whenever I had a break or free time slot, but that still wouldn't be enough to meet all of my academic demands. Once this was all over, I would be stuck in my house because my parents are really strict. Instead of fully facing my problems, I would skateboard to the creek near my neighborhood and just sit for a couple of hours until the sunset. I'd just look at the dead shrubbery and murky water, remembering how it didn't used to be this way. I'd ponder and reflect over my surroundings and myself, what I've done and what I dream of doing. High school hasn't been all too kind to me, and knowing that I had to write an essay about it... Just made me a little uneasy. I was doing this same thing the Thursday night before it was due. It was a really poor decision because of the little time I had, but I felt like I really needed to free my mind and pull myself together. I went again earlier and recorded it to share with you, if you wanted to see (it's pretty long so I understand if you don't!). It was like my childhood Disneyland before it turned all dirty, and lifeless. But I still find parts of it to be beautiful :).
                <br><br>Sorry I digressed a lot in this letter. I just really wanted to show you that I do care and explain a little! If I could go back in time, I'd finish my essay long before it's due and study an extra ton to be prepared for your test. Your class means a lot to me and so does your trust. I would never intend to do anything that would jeopardize that. In the future, I am definitely going to be more critical with myself on time management and doing the right thing. I will completely respect and understand your decision on this current situation! I will do my best to make up for my mistake and earn back your trust and forgiveness in time! Thank you so much for everything! I really hope you have a wonderful day, and I'm sorry for what I've done, and if this is so long Dx!</h11><br><br>
